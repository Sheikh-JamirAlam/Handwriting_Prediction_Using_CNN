# Handwriting_Prediction_Using_CNN
Handwritten Character recognition is the ability of computers to recognize human handwritten characters. Or in easy words we can say that it is the ability of computers to detect the character present in a particular image and recognize that character. This model uses two datasets - A to Z Handwritten Dataset and MNIST Dataset to predict handwritten letters using convolution neural networks. After importing the libraries, we can used its method for loading the MNIST dataset. The A to Z Handwritten Dataset was downloaded from Kaggle and has been provided here.
